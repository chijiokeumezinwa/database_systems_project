The files that populated my tables full of data are in DataGenerated.
In FinalProject_Customer.java, this interface allows you to query the database with your name and given customer id.

-Log in to database with name and password (keep in mind both are case sensitive)
	
	-When you run the program, the program will ask for your first name and last name. The names are case sensitive so take care to make sure you have the right case.You are allowed to use apostrophe characters as well as period characters and hyphen characters. You can enter more than one name for the first name and last name category and put a space or a hyphen character. The only condition is that your first and last names must be alphabet letters, with a length of at least 2. In addition, the program will ask for your id number.

	-If you are a new customer, enter your first name and last name, and enter the number 1 for the id number or any number you wish. You will be redirected to filling out a customer account if you wish or you could exit the interface. Follow the instructions to setting up a customer account and your account will be registered with your name, id, address, country, planet, and email address. You will then be directed to enter your credit card number or debit card number. Type in confirm to submit your new account.
	

	-If you are a returning customer,  enter your first name and last name and enter your id number. Your address and name will be printed, with an option to update your name, address, country, planet, email address, and credit card or debit card information. Type in yes to confirm the changes if you decide to update your profile. Otherwise you can type in no to exit out of updating your account. If you already submitted the updated information, but with an error, you can log back with the name you had uploaded to your account. You should still retain your original customer id

	If you realize after you pass the update information stage, submit what you have and run the program again to submit the correct updated information. 	ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT: when logging in to correct a mistake in your name, make sure to log in with the wrong name you had accidentally submitted. The 	database will not recognize your account otherwise.
	

	-Next, a list of the current cars new and used that are owned by you will be printed. 
	
	-There is a prompt asking if you would wish to purchase a new vehicle. Follow the prompts that will be printed on the screen and you can choose whether to purchase a factory vehicle or not.

	-There is a prompt asking if you would wish to purchase a used vehicle. Follow the prompts that will be printed on the screen and you can choose whether to purchase a used vehicle or not.
